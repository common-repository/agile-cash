== Installation ==

* Install it as you would any other plugin
* Activate it
* Head over to WooCommerce » Settings » Payments
* Click Manage for "Pay using cryptocurrency"
* Enter the associated wallet address to receive payments, select the desire exchanges to get pricing data from, and you are good to go!
* If you are utilizing the Electrum Wallet feature, we highly recommend creating a brand new Electrum Wallet Master Public Key and only using one Electrum Wallet per store. We also recommend increasing your gap limit in electrum to 100.
